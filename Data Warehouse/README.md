# Project 3 : Data Warehouse

## Overview

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

The goal of this project is to build an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stage them in Redshift, and transform data into a set of dimensional tables for the analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs the users are listening to.

## Dataset
There are two datasets that reside in S3.

   Song data: `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`
   Log data: `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`
    
Log data json path: `s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json`

### 1. Song dataset
Song dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Datase](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/).
Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID.

File path examples:
`song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json`


Sample data in a single file:
```
{
"num_songs": 1, 
"artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", 
"artist_latitude": null, 
"artist_longitude": null, 
"artist_location": "", 
"artist_name": "Line Renaud", 
"song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", 
"title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", 
"duration": 152.92036, 
"year": 0
}
```

### 2. Log dataset
Log dataset consists of log files generated by [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the song dataset.
The log files in the dataset are partitioned by year and month.

Filepaths of two files in this dataset:

`log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json`


Sample data:
```
{
"artist": "Survivor", 
"auth": "Logged In", 
"firstName": "Jayden", 
"gender": "M", 
"itemInSession": 0, 
"lastName": "Fox", 
"length": 245.36771, 
"level": "free", 
"location": "New Orleans-Metairie, LA", 
"method": "PUT",
"page": "NextSong", 
"registration": 1541033612796, 
"sessionId": 100, 
"song": "Eye Of The Tiger", 
"status": 200, 
"ts": 1541110994796, 
"userAgent": "\"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/36.0.1985.143 Safari/537.36\"", 
"userId": "101"
}
```


## Database Schema Design
A star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis is created by using the below tables.

### Fact tables
**songplays** : Records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page `NextSong`
> songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

### Dimension tables
**users** : users in the app
> user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level

**songs** : songs in music database
> song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration

**artists** : artists in music database
> artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude

**time** : timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
> start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday


## Project Files

`sql_queries.py` : contains sql queries for dropping and creating fact and dimension tables as well as insertion query templates.

`create_tables.py` : drops and creates ***sparkify*** database for the star schema in Redshift. This file is run before each ETL script run to reset the tables.

`etl.py` : loads data from S3 into staging tables on Redshift and then process that data into the analytics tables on Redshift. 

`README.md` : Markdown file that gives a summary of the project.

`dhw.cfg` : Configuration file used that contains info about Redshift, IAM and S3

`Create Redshift Cluster and IAM role.ipynb` : Jupyter notebook containing code to create Redshift cluster and IAM role.


## Project Steps
Below are steps to be followed to complete each component of this project.

### 1. Create Table Schemas
1. Design schemas for the fact and dimension tables
2. Write a SQL CREATE statement for each of these tables in `sql_queries.py`
3. Complete the logic in `create_tables.py` to connect to the database and create these tables
4. Write SQL DROP statements to drop tables in the beginning of `create_tables.py` if the tables already exist.
5. Create an IAM user in AWS and include the access key and secret in dwh.cfg
6. Using the access key and secret, launch a redshift cluster and create an IAM role that has read access to S3 by running `Create Redshift Cluster and IAM role.ipynb`.
7. Add redshift database and IAM role info to dwh.cfg.
8. Test by running create_tables.py and checking the table schemas in your redshift database. Query Editor in the AWS Redshift console can be used for this.

### 2. Build ETL Pipeline
1. Implement the logic in etl.py to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift.
2. Implement the logic in etl.py to load data from staging tables to analytics tables on Redshift.
3. Test by running etl.py after running create_tables.py and running the analytic queries on the Redshift database to compare the results with the expected results.
4. Delete the redshift cluster when finished.


## Execution Instructions

1. Launch and run `Create Redshift Cluster and IAM role.ipynb` to create Redshift cluster and IAM role.
1. Run `create_tables.py` in the terminal to create the database and table structure
2. Execute `etl.py` to extract and load the data to the tables.
