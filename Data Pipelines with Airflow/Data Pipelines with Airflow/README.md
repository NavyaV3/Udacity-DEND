# Project 5 : Data Pipelines

## Overview

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to  introduce more automation and monitoring to their data warehouse ETL pipelines and came to the conclusion that the best tool to achieve this is Apache Airflow. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app and needs to be processed in Sparkify's data warehouse in Amazon Redshift.

The goal of this project is to create high grade data pipelines that are dynamic and built from reusable tasks, can be monitored, and allow easy backfills.
Data quality plays a big part when analyses are executed on top of the data warehouse and tests are to be run against the datasets after the ETL steps have been executed to catch any discrepancies in the datasets.

## Dataset
There are two datasets that reside in S3.

   Song data: `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`
   Log data: `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`
    

### 1. Song dataset
Song dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Datase](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/).
Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID.

File path examples:
`song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json`


Sample data in a single file:
```
{
"num_songs": 1, 
"artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", 
"artist_latitude": null, 
"artist_longitude": null, 
"artist_location": "", 
"artist_name": "Line Renaud", 
"song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", 
"title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", 
"duration": 152.92036, 
"year": 0
}
```

### 2. Log dataset
Log dataset consists of log files generated by [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the song dataset.
The log files in the dataset are partitioned by year and month.

Filepaths of two files in this dataset:

`log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json`


Sample data:
```
{
"artist": "Survivor", 
"auth": "Logged In", 
"firstName": "Jayden", 
"gender": "M", 
"itemInSession": 0, 
"lastName": "Fox", 
"length": 245.36771, 
"level": "free", 
"location": "New Orleans-Metairie, LA", 
"method": "PUT",
"page": "NextSong", 
"registration": 1541033612796, 
"sessionId": 100, 
"song": "Eye Of The Tiger", 
"status": 200, 
"ts": 1541110994796, 
"userAgent": "\"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/36.0.1985.143 Safari/537.36\"", 
"userId": "101"
}
```


## Design
A star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis is created by using the below tables.

### Fact tables
**songplays** : Records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page `NextSong`
> songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

### Dimension tables
**users** : users in the app
> user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level

**songs** : songs in music database
> song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration

**artists** : artists in music database
> artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude

**time** : timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
> start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

### DAG Design

## Project Files

`udac_datapip_dag.py` : Contains all the imports and task templates of the DAG. 

`README.md` : Markdown file that gives a summary of the project.

`create_tables.sql` : Contains the SQL queries used to create the required tables in Redshift. This file should be placed in the same folder as `udac_datapip_dag.py`.

`sql_queries.py` : Contains the SQL queries to load the data in the Redshift tables.

`stage_redshift.py` : Contains code for the `StageToRedshiftOperator` which copies data from JSON files in S3 to staging tables in the Redshift data warehouse.

`load_fact.py` : Contains code for the `LoadFactOperator` which loads the data in the staging tables to the fact table.

`load_dimension.py` : Contains code for the `LoadDimensionOperator` which loads data from the staging tables into dimension tables.

`data_quality.py` : contains code for the `DataQualityOperator` which runs checks on the data by receiving SQL queries and expected results as arguments, executing the tests and failing if the results don't match.


## Execution Instructions

1. Run `/opt/airflow/start.sh` command to start the Airflow web server.
2. Use Airflow's UI to configure AWS credentials and connection to Redshift.
